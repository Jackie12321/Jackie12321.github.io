					One of my favourite games is called Valorant, it is a first person shooter game and you are placed on an arena/map where you and four other team
					members are faced against five other opposing enemies. The objective of the game on attacker side is to either defeat the entire enemy team,
					or plant a deadly bomb called spike and defending it until it detonates. On the other team the defender side, you must defend the site, protecting
					your side at all costs, or you can run the clock down by hiding, but that's no fun.
					
					Throughout my entire experience of the game from beta to present, I have spent countless hours to have reached the second highest rank in competitive
					gameplay called Immortal. There is a ladder of ranks you may achieve by playing competitively against other talented players. They are as listed from
					lowest to highest: Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Ascendant, Immortal, Radiant.
					
					I highly recommend trying out the game, but be cautious as some players take the game more seriously than others and can over react in different
					situations.
