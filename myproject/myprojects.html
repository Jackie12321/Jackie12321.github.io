				<p>
					This is my <b><i>Pizza Menu Project</b></i> coded in Java using JavaFX. Using basic clickable buttons and interactive selections, the user is allowed to
					select their preferences from the variety of choices and can later save it into a text file and reload all the information. It has simple
					graphics, but it is readable and easy to follow without instructions. There can be as little to as many different combinations of orders
					and simply typing the exact name you inputted will bring up all your information from when you last submitted.

				<h2>Paint Project</h2>
				<img class = "proj3" src="paint.jpg" alt="My Paint Project">
				<p>
					This is my <i><b>Paint Project</b></i> coded in Python with Pygame. This program is designed to look similar to Microsoft Paint and allows for saving, loading,
					redo and undo. It detects when the user has made a selection with a left mouse click. Once a tool has been chosen, the user can draw whatever they
					would like onto the canvas and can save it for later uses. There are a few stamps that you can drag and drop onto the canvas as everything is within
					a specified theme.
