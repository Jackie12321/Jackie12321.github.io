					<p class = "left">
						My name is Jackie Li, I am currently studying at the University of Windsor pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science Degree. The reason
						I decided to work with computers and explore various programming environments is because I enjoy playing video games. At first, it was
						mainly for entertainment, but then my inspiration grew and I thought about how everything worked behind the scenes. Such as, where the
						players' data is stored with the great number of people creating accounts, and this is similar to many companies and their services like banks.
						It is fascinating to me and I wanted to learn how to do something similar and find new ways to grow my own experiences. Eventually my goal
						is to make my own video game as a hobby and share it with others through my experiences and possibly teach someone my thought process
						and inspire other people.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am an easy-going person, I treat everyone with full respect and I have social awareness. I try to help anyone the best I can by doing self
						research combined with my own thoughts and experiences. I am persistent when I am stuck on a problem, I do my best to break it down to solve
						it in different parts instead of letting it overwhelm me.
